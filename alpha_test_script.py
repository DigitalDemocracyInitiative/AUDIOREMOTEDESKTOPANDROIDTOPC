# alpha_test_script.py
#
# Purpose:
# This script serves as an alpha test harness for the PC client application (`script.py`).
# It is designed to programmatically launch the client, simulate a period of interaction
# (or allow it to run for a fixed duration), capture its console output (stdout and stderr),
# and then terminate the client. This facilitates automated or semi-automated testing.
#
# Key Functionalities to be Included:
# 1. Launching the `script.py` (PC client) as a separate process.
# 2. Simulating user interaction by letting the client run for a specified duration.
# 3. Capturing and printing/logging the stdout and stderr from the client process.
# 4. Programmatically terminating the client process.
# 5. (Conceptual) Defining test points or checks based on expected log output or behavior.

import time
import sys # To use the same Python interpreter for the client script

# --- Test Configuration Constants ---
CONNECTION_WAIT_TIME = 10  # seconds, to wait for client to potentially connect
TEST_DURATION = 15         # seconds, to simulate client running time
TERMINATE_TIMEOUT = 5      # seconds, timeout for process.terminate()
COMMUNICATE_TIMEOUT = 5    # seconds, timeout for process.communicate()

# --- Conceptual Test Functions (Placeholders) ---

def simulate_audio_input_conceptual():
    # This is a placeholder for simulating audio input to the PC client.
    # In a real test, this might involve:
    # 1. Using a library (like PyAudio or sounddevice) to play a pre-recorded WAV file.
    # 2. Directing this playback to a virtual audio loopback device.
    # 3. Configuring the PC client (or the system) to use this virtual device as its microphone input.
    #    - This might require manual setup or OS-level configuration beforehand.
    #    - Alternatively, if the client could be modified to accept an audio file path
    #      for testing, that would simplify this.

def verify_test_results_conceptual(stdout_logs, stderr_logs):
    # This is a placeholder for verifying test results.
    # In a real test, this would involve:
    # 1. Parsing stdout_logs and stderr_logs for specific messages:
    #    - Confirmation of WebSocket connection ("WebSocket connection established.").
    #    - Indication of active streaming ("Status: Connected. Streaming...").
    #    - Receipt of simulated audio response from server (e.g., client might log "Received X bytes from server").
    #    - Absence of critical error messages in stderr.
    # 2. If audio output from the client was saved (e.g., to a file, not implemented in client):
    #    - Loading the received audio.
    #    - Performing analysis (e.g., checking if it matches an expected signal like a sine wave,
    #      or comparing it to a reference file). This could involve signal processing.
    # 3. Reporting pass/fail status based on these checks.
